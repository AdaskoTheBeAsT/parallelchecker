Getting Started with the Parallel Checker 
-----------------------------------

Prerequisites:
- Visual Studio (R) 2022, Version 17.2.5 onwards

*******************************************************************************************
** For previous VS 2019 support, see separate Parallel Checker release in VS Marketplace **
*******************************************************************************************

Previous checker versions for older Visual Studio (R) versions can also be found under: https://github.com/blaeser/parallelchecker.

Installation:
1. Download the parallel checker release for your Visual Studio (R) version.
2. Double click "ConcurrencyLab.ParallelChecker.vsix" and run the installation program.
3. Start or restart Visual Studio (R). 
4. Open a .NET solution with at least one C# project.
5. Open the "Error List" view. Enable information messages with the blue icon to see whether the checker has run. 
   Checker messages will here be listed with a delay of a few seconds. 
6. If messages do not appear right away after opening the solution, it may help to build the solution or edit and save the source code to trigger the background analysis process.

- Checker information messages (with the blue icon) are turned on by default. 
  To deactivate them, go to Tools->Options->Parallel Checker: Set "Diagnostic Checker Information" to "false". Reload the solution or restart VS.
